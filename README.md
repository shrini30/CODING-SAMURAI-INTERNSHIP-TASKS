House Price Prediction using Linear Regression and Machine Learning

This repository contains a project that predicts house prices using Linear Regression, a fundamental algorithm in Machine Learning. The model utilizes a dataset of house features and their respective prices to learn the relationship between the features and the target variable (price).

Features
Implementation of Linear Regression using scikit-learn.
Preprocessing of data, including handling missing values and selecting relevant features.
Visualization of dataset insights and correlation analysis.
Evaluation of model performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
A structured Python script with comments for better understanding.

Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains multiple features like:
Number of bedrooms
Number of bathrooms
Square footage of living area
Lot size
Number of floors
Waterfront presence (binary)
View score
Condition rating
Price (target variable)
If you want to use your own dataset, ensure it is structured with relevant features and a target column.

Requirements

Results
The model achieved the following metrics on the test dataset:
Mean Squared Error (MSE): Displayed in the output.
R-squared: Displayed in the output.
A correlation heatmap provides insights into feature relationships, and the evaluation metrics validate the effectiveness of the model.

Future Improvements
Experiment with advanced regression models like Ridge or Lasso Regression.
Incorporate feature engineering to improve predictions.
Test on a larger dataset for better generalization.
Develop a web interface for real-time predictions.
